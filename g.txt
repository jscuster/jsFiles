<h1>JS Files, by Jason Custer</h1>

<p>This program allows users to encode files to data URLs. All files will be stored in a javascript object called jsFiles. By default, the keys to the hash object are the file names, but you can rename these keys.</p>

<h2>How it works.</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use the file uploader to upload files.</li>
<li>Select a file in the dropdown,</li>
<li>Change the name in the rename box,</li>
<li>click "Update" to save the new name.</li>
<li>Type the name of your base object, the files will be <yourBaseObject>.jsFiles. This helps avoid collisions.</li>
<li>Finally, click the save button to generate a download link, then right-click and save the file as <filename>.js. Note that the .js extension will likely not be added automatically, so be sure to add it.</li>
</ol>

<p>To use the encoded files in your project:</p>

<ol>
<li>include the script you saved in the previous steps. <em>Include it before you need it of course.</em></li>
<li>To get a file's data url, use your-base-object.jsFiles["your-file-name"]</li>
<li>If you feel lost, encode a small file with the previous steps, then look at the resulting script.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for using JS Files!</p>
